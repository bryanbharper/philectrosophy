# Introduction

I love weird music. I love to share and talk about this weird music. So, not surprisingly, I've occasionally been called a music snob, pretentious, or whatever. And I totally get where they're coming from. I think I'd say the same if I were in their shoes.

But! I'm going to argue that I'm not pretentious about music at all -- which admittedly sounds pretentious in and of itself (it doesn't help that I'm using the fancy sounding word 'phenomenology' either, but there really isn't a better word for it) -- in fact, quite the opposite. I'm just an insatiable hedonist.

# The Music Snob

 - Create an archetype
    - Intellectual
    - Cultural Significance
    - Lyrical Meaning
    - etc.
    - Appears to like the idea of the music more than the music itself

- Note that this is a perfectly valid way to enjoy music, and people who are like this probably don't deserve the criticism. Why yuck someone's yum.

# Sonic Psychedelia

- What does phenomenology mean
- How do I experience music
    - Sonic
    - Get High
    - Immersive
    - Transported
    - Psychedelic
    - Unaware of lyrics
        - Don't verbally process well. Parents thought I might be deaf because I would mutter gibberish to myself until I was about five.

So I don't like music for the reason the "Music Snob" does. I liken it to ice cream? Why do you like ice cream? Because it tastes good! And when the fellow behind the counter asks if I want sprinkles, I say 'Yes please'! Add gummies? Yes. Combine three different types of ice cream? Yes. Add reeses pieces? Caramel? Fudge? Yes! Yes! Yes!

If you enjoyed vanilla ice cream, and somewhat came up to you with all the ingredients I listed above on their icecream and said "dude I love this, you should try it, it's SO GOOD" would you call them an ice cream snob?!

# Why I Come Across as Pretentious

- Trying to Verbalize why I like something
    - It probably seems like I have the idea that I verbalize, and that causes me to like the music. But it's the opposite. Think of the ice cream again. I might say "Wow, the way the fudge and cookie dough interact is divine". What's happening is that I'm having two kinds of hedonistic pleasures interacting to create a new type of pleasure. And it's that experience that I'm trying to verbalize. But I think it comes across as heady, as though it's the idea itself that I'm saying is pleasurable, rather than the idea being a vehicle to communicate the raw feeling.

- Tolerance
    - The other reason I think I come across as pretentious is my lack of interest in more ordinary music. It admittedly does bore me, and I can see why that *could* be pretentious. But I think it's important *why* it bores me. It's not that I think it's inferior. It's that I've been taking heroin and you're offering me chamomile tea. There's nothing wrong with chamomile. But I'm a hedonist chasing a high, and chamomile just ain't gonna do it for me.

So, with regard to music, I'm just a kid in a candy store.
