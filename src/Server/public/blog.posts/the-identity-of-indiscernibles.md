### 1. &nbsp; Leibniz's Law and Its Controversy

Recall from logic class Leibniz's law:

[MATH]\begin{matrix}\forall F \, \forall_x \forall_y \left[ \left( F_x \leftrightarrow F_y \right ) \leftrightarrow x = y \right ] & (1.1)\end{matrix}[/MATH]

Or should I say Leibniz's *laws*? There were in actuality two formulations:

[MATH]\begin{matrix}\forall F\,\forall_x\,\forall_y\,[x=y\rightarrow (Fx\leftrightarrow Fy)] & (1.2) \end{matrix}[/MATH]

[MATH]\begin{matrix}\forall F\, \forall_x\,\forall_y\,[(Fx\leftrightarrow Fy)\rightarrow x=y] & (1.3)\end{matrix}[/MATH]

Let's call the relationship [IMATH]x = y[/IMATH] *numerical identity* and call [IMATH]F_x  \leftrightarrow F_y[/IMATH] *property identity*. And by properties I mean not only features instantiated on or in an object (i.e., what are often called 'intrinsic properties', e.g., redness), but also the object's spatial-temporal properties (i.e., its position vector [IMATH]\vec{r}(t) = \langle x(t), y(t), z(t) \rangle[/IMATH]), and relational or extrinsic properties (e.g., 'North of...').

The first formulation of Leibniz's law (1.2), which is called the *indiscernibility of identicals* is entirely uncontroversial. It states that if two things are numerically identical, then those two things are property identical. Obviously, if Superman is 6 ft tall, so is Clark Kent. Moreover, any property that Superman has (at a specific time) Clark Kent has also, and vice versa.

The second formulation of Leibniz's law (1.3), called the *identity of indiscernibles*, is not so uncontroversial. It states that if two things are property identical, then they are numerically identical. Imagine that [IMATH]x[/IMATH] occupies exactly the same space at exactly the same time as [IMATH]y[/IMATH], and that any property one has, the other has. To many, including myself, it seems obvious that under these conditions, [IMATH]x[/IMATH] and [IMATH]y[/IMATH] are one and the same thing, i.e., [IMATH]x = y[/IMATH]. Nevertheless, it is considered by many to be controversial or even false.

The reason for this controversy has to do with apparent counter-examples. Candidate counter-examples suggest that there are conceivable scenarios where two or more non-numerically-identical objects have coextensive property sets:

> "Isn't it logically possible that the universe contained nothing but two exactly similar spheres? We might suppose that each was made of chemically pure iron, each a diameter of one mile, that they had the same temperature, color, and so on, and that nothing else existed. Then every quality and relational characteristic of the one would also be a property of the other."[POP] Black, Max, 2012, "The Identity of Indiscernibles"[/POP]

If this is a genuine possibility, then (1.3) must be false.

There are additional candidate counter examples, but I can't possibly go through them all. However, as far as I can tell they are essentially the same, with only superficial differences. So, in my defense of (1.3) I will refer to just two of these counter examples --- one from Black[POP] Black, Max, 2012, "The Identity of Indiscernibles"[/POP] and another from Adams[POP]Adams, R.M., 1979 "Primitive Thisness and Primitive Identity". Journal of Philosophy, 76: 5-26.[/POP].

### 2. &nbsp; Response

Let's join Black and imagine two indiscernible spheres. Now, when you picture these spheres, do you picture them as co-located, such that they occupy the exact same place in your imagined visual space? I wouldn't think so. The intuition that there are two objects rather than one disappears if they occupy the same imagined visual space. If I pointed to a bowling ball and told you that it was actually two indistinguishable co-located bowling balls, I'd have to provide some pretty compelling evidence to convince you. And Black concedes this:

> "Now if two spheres must be in different places, as indeed they must, to say that the spheres occupy different places is to say no more than they are two spheres."[POP] Black, Max, 2012, "The Identity of Indiscernibles"[/POP]

But if Black's spheres are not co-located, wouldn't they have distinct spatio-temporal properties? Black gets around this by postulating that the spheres occupy a spatially relativistic, perfectly symmetrical world. In such a world everything must be specified in relation to one another. Instead of saying one sphere is five feet in the positive direction from the absolute origin, and the other is five feed in the negative direction, we can only say that both spheres have the property of being ten feet from the other sphere.

Alright, so let's return to imagining Black's scenario. I look to the left and see a sphere. I look to the right and see the same thing. And there is no discernible property to distinguish one from the other, and yet there *appear* to be two things; one to the left and one to the right.

What about my role as an observer in this scenario? Does the sphere I imagine to the left have the property of *being to the left of me* and the one on the right *being to the right of me*? If this is the case, then the spheres are not property identical. But perhaps this is unfair --- the situation described by Black stipulates a world containing only two objects, the spheres in question. Sneaking in a third object, the observer, is cheating, no?

> "...it was logically possible for them to enter into different relationships with a third object. But this would be a change in the universe.[POP] Black, Max, 2012, "The Identity of Indiscernibles"[/POP]

I bring this up, however, to point out a difficultly. When we imagine the scenario, of necessity we implicitly sneak in this observer, as we must be imagining the scenario from some perspective or other. And this influences our intuition about the conceivability of the scenario, as the addition of an observer creates distinct relational properties. So whatever intuition which tells us there are two spheres rather than one cannot stem from the perspective from which we invision Black's world. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to sus out which intuitions do and do not match this criterion. But I personally have yet to find a way to imagine the spheres so as to arrive at the conclusion there are two, while also not introducing a perspective which makes them *not* property identical. But we'll put that aside for now.

Let's try a more concrete objection to Black's alleged counter example:

First, what's to prevent us from establishing, by convention, a coordinate system for Black's world? Assuming the spheres are not co-located, such a coordinate system can be used to discern one sphere from the other, just as it could in absolute space. Black might object that establishing such a coordinate system adds a new thing to the world, making our coordinate system-ed world a different one from the world he postulated. But this isn't right. Establishing conventions doesn't change reality. If we agree one direction is left and the opposite is right, we haven't changed the world in any way, we've only changed how we conceptualize it.

A second objection: Let's consider again the first sentence of Black's description above, this time with my emphasis:
> "Isn't it logically possible that the universe contained nothing but **two** exactly similar spheres?"[POP] Black, Max, 2012, "The Identity of Indiscernibles"[/POP]

Does this not outright beg the question? In essence, Black has said:
> Imagine two things. Now imagine they are property identical. Aha, two things that are property-identical! Identity of indiscernibles is false, Q.E.D!

He stipulates at the outset that there are *two* things, and then asserts that they are property-identical. Hacking
raises the same object:
> "In arguing that in a certain possible world there exist two distinct but indistinguishable objects, bland assertion that there are two such objects is not enough. There must be argument."[POP]Hacking, I., 1975, The Identity of Indiscernibles, Journal of Philosophy, 72 (9): 249-256.[/POP]

A class of variations on Black's example is illustrated by Adams.[POP]Adams, R.M., 1979 "Primitive Thisness and Primitive Identity". Journal of Philosophy, 76: 5-26.[/POP] Like Black, Adams imagines two property identical spheres, but at some time [IMATH]t_0[/IMATH] one spontaneously has a scratch on its surface. With one sphere now having a scratch, the spheres are no longer property identical, and via (1.2), they are distinct. If (1.3) is true, then we went from having one object to miraculously having two! But creation ex nihilo is clearly absurd, so (1.3) must be rejected.

Now, if we only consider the spheres' intrinsic properties at a given moment in time, the counter example does it's job. But why should we so restrict ourselves? I used to live in Colorado. This is a fact about me. I bear the property of *having previously lived in Colorado* even though I don't currently live here. This property, is extrinsic and temporal.

Returning to Adam's spheres, if we compare the complete set of temporal properties of the two spheres, one will have the property of being scratched at [IMATH]t_0[/IMATH] and the other will not. So they are not property identical, and thereby do not violate the identity of indiscernibles.
