## Introduction

I've just completed dry January! Well, it was mostly dry. Some exceptions were made. Ultimately, however, I went from averaging around 1.7 drinks per day in December to only 0.3 in January. That's about 5.6 times less, so I'll count that as a win.

Like most people, I wanted to cut back on drinking for the health benefits. I was hoping for better sleep, a greater sense of well-being, and ideally some weight loss. There's loads of research on the negative effects of drinking, and conversely the benefits of cutting back. So, my hopes for improved health were not unfounded.

Rather than simply reflecting on how this month felt, I thought it would be fun to attempt to quantify the impact of cutting back. I'll be looking at three metrics: *well-being, sleep-quality, and weight-loss*. I'll measure well-being by running a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) on my journal entries from December and January. Sleep quality will be tracked by my Fitbit sleep score. Lastly, for weight... well, that's self-explanatory.

> *A big ol' grain of salt:* While quantitative, this is in no way scientific. It's a sample size of one, there are no controls, it's not double-blind, etc. etc..

## Well-Being

Let me first admit that my knowledge of [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is pretty limited. I'd say, on the graph below, I'm probably near the summit of "mount stupid":

Nevertheless, with no idea what I'm doing, I decided to plow ahead and run my journal entries from December and January through a sentiment analysis tool to see how positive or negative my headspace was during these periods. I used [this](https://www.danielsoper.com/sentimentanalysis/) online tool. Is it reliable? I don't know. Have I properly prepared the input data? I don't know. One day I'd really like to dig into the subject of sentiment analysis, but that day is not today.

The tool gives a sentiment score between -100 and +100, and is supposed to measure the positivity or negativity of emotions conveyed by the input text. Here are the results:

| Month      | &nbsp; Score |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| December  | &nbsp; +4.0       |
| January   | &nbsp; -27.3        |

This is not what I would have expected going into the month. However, having now lived through January 2021... yea. On the 6th, insurrectionists stormed the Capitol. After that, there was a lot of toxic politics, crazy conspiracy theories, and the looming threat of right-wing terrorism. Unfortunately, that stuff got to me. I did a lot of doom scrolling. So, yea, the results aren't too surprising, all things considered.

This goes to show why anecdotal evidence (and small sample sizes) make for unreliable evidence. It would be tempting to conclude from the table above that abstaining from drink made me less happy. But, of course, there's always the possibility that the results were just a one-off fluke. It also speaks to the need for controls in an experiment. Clearly, I was not isolated from outside factors that might impact the results.

So, unfortunately, I don't think we can draw any meaningful conclusion about how dry January impacted my well-being. Oh, well.

## Sleep

This is where I expected cutting back to have the greatest impact. I know that alcohol causes me to wake up in the middle of the night, and I often feel pretty crummy the day following a couple of drinks. What do the numbers say?

| Month      | &nbsp; Score | &nbsp; Standard Deviation |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| December  | &nbsp; 79.8 | &nbsp; 5.1 |
| January   | &nbsp;  79.5 | &nbsp; 5.3 |

Cutting back drinking appears to have had no impact.

Again, while I wouldn't have expected this before January, I'm not surprised after the fact. One thing I noticed pretty early on was that my behavior in the evening had changed. Normally, around 6pm I might have a drink, signalling to myself that it was time to wind down for the evening. I might have another drink or two while reading or watch TV and then get sleepy around 9pm.

But this month was different. Instead of winding down, I found myself with energy to spare. So, I would continue to work on things (this blog, work, house stuff, etc.) much later than I normally would. When 9pm rolled around, I was still wired and had no desire to go to bed. Eventually, I'd force myself to get in bed, but my mind would still be whirring.

I was getting to bed later and having a harder time falling asleep. That said, once I did fall asleep, I would sleep through the night without interruption. I suspect that with some time to adjust I could retrain my body to wind down on its own.

While teetotalling wasn't a magic sleep bullet, I don't think we can definitively conclude that it wouldn't be beneficial, if properly implemented.

## Weight

As we all know, 2020 was rough. And, like a lot of people, I'm not very happy to have to admit that I gained a lot of weight. Like, a lot. About 30 lbs 🙃. My general practitioner even quipped "wow, you've really been pigging out" --- needless to say, I have a new GP now.

So, I was hoping that saying bye bye to the mai tais would allow me to shed some pounds.[POP]I've actually never had a mai tai... they look tasty though. Comment with a recipe :)[/POP] Let's look at the numbers:

| Date      | &nbsp; Weight |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| December 31 | &nbsp; 186.5      |
| January 30  |&nbsp; 184.9       |

There was a *slight* decrease of about 1.6 lbs. Not nothing. However, in September I had reached my peak weight of about 196 lbs, which means that between September and December I was losing an average of 3.3 lbs a month. Given that, 1.6 lbs isn't particularly encouraging when put in perspective.

Again, as January went on I noticed an unexpected behavior change. When I was working late into the evening and over-clocking my noggin, I found that my ability to resist impulses, like mindless snacking, was greatly impaired. I've read about this phenomena before. In [one study](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/209563?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) participants were asked to remember of sequence of digits and then asked to choose between a choice of snacks. Subjects with longer sequences of numbers were more likely to indulge in the less healthy snack options. A plausible explanation for the finding is that when our executive functions are occupied or depleted, decision-making is left to our more emotional, baser faculties.

So, that's one (very speculative) explanation for the somewhat disappointing weight-loss results.

## Conclusion

Well, on all accounts, I didn't get the results I'd hoped for. Nevertheless, I'd still like to try abstaining for another extended period and to cut back in general. Why would I say that, after such disappointing results? Well, there's a lot of research that ties reduction in alcohol intake to improved health. And what's more probable, that all those studies are wrong, or that my one-off anecdotal evidence was simply a fluke? I think the latter.
