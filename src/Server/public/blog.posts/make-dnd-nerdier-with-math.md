## Introduction
I love math. I love D&D. Lucky for me, the two go together like peanut butter and jelly.

Want to know whether you should pick up a feat that lets you roll with advantage or increase your ability stats for a fatter modifier? Curious just how much that +1 weapon will help you? Do you have any chance of taking on this dragon? This post will give you the probability basics you need to answer these questions.

## The Basics

> Everything that follows is based on 5e. Also, it doesn't consider the optional rule where a natural 20 or 1 is an automatic success or failure, respectively.

### Flat Success

In the most basic scenario (no advantage, disadvantage, ect.) what are your odds of success?

Ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls all have the same form:

[MATH]1\text{d}20+m \geq t[/MATH]

Where [IMATH]m[/IMATH] is the sum of modifiers and proficiencies a character has on the roll, and [IMATH]t[/IMATH] is the difficulty or armor class (DC or AC respectively) of the task or enemy --- we'll use [IMATH]t[/IMATH] to stand for *target* number.[POP]*'d' for difficulty* is a bad choice of variable, as you also have __d__ice, and the differential symbol --- eg., [IMATH]dx[/IMATH] --- to cause confusion.[/POP] All DCs and ACs are integer values on [1, 30].

Denote the result of a d20  roll as [IMATH]X[/IMATH], and denote set of possible successful rolls as [IMATH]S[/IMATH]. Success requires that [IMATH]X+m \geq t[/IMATH], so we can define [IMATH]S[/IMATH] extensionally:

[MATH]S = \{ X = 20 \; \cup \; X = 19 \; \cup \ldots \cup \; X = t - m \}[/MATH]

It follows that the number of possible success events is:

[MATH]\begin{align*} |S| &= 20 - (t-m) + 1 \\ &= 21 + m - t \end{align*}[/MATH]

There are twenty possible outcomes of the roll, so the cardinality of sample  space is:

[MATH]|X|=20.[/MATH]

From this we know that the probability that a d20 lands on a given value, [IMATH]x[/IMATH], is:

[MATH]\begin{align*} P(X=x) &= \frac{1}{|X|} \\ &= \frac{1}{20}  \end{align*}[/MATH]

Finally, we can derive an equation which answers the question, *what are my odds of success in any given basic roll?*

[MATH]\begin{align*} P(S) &= \sum \limits_{i=1}^{|S|} P(X = i) &\text{[members of $E$ are pairwise disjoint.]} \\ &= \sum \limits_{i=1}^{|S|} P(X = x) &\text{[members of $E$ are equiprobable.]}  \\ &= |S| P(X=x) & \\ &= (21 + m - t) \left( \frac{1}{20} \right) & \end{align*}[/MATH]

For ease of communication let's call this the *flat-success* function, [IMATH]s_f[/IMATH]:

> [MATH]s_f(t, m) \equiv P(S) = (21 + m - t) \left( \frac{1}{20} \right)[/MATH]

### Advantage & Disadvantage

#### Disadvantage
When rolling with advantage or disadvantage, there are two independent dice rolls [IMATH]X_1[/IMATH] and [IMATH]X_2[/IMATH]. To succeed at a disadvantaged roll *both* dice rolls must be above the AC / DC (minus any modifiers). That is, we need to know that probability of both [IMATH]S_1[/IMATH] *and* [IMATH]S_2[/IMATH] occuring:

[MATH]\begin{align*} P(S_d) &= P(S_1 \cap S_2) & \\ &= P(S_1) P(S_2) &\text{[$S_1$ and $S_2$ are independent.]} \\ &= P(S)^{2}&\text{[$S_1$ and $S_2$ are equiprobable.]} \\ &= s_f(t, m)^{2} & \end{align*} [/MATH]

Let's call this the *disadvantaged-success* function, [IMATH]s_d[/IMATH], and substitute in [IMATH]s_f[/IMATH]:

> [MATH]s_d(t,m) = (21 + m - t )^2 \left( \frac{1}{20} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{400} (21 + m - t)^2 [/MATH]

#### Advantage

To succeed at an advantaged roll, all that is required is that *either* [IMATH]X_1[/IMATH] *or* [IMATH]X_2[/IMATH] is greater the AC / DC (minus any modifiers):

[IMATH]\begin{align*} P(S_a) &= P \left(S_1 \cup S_2 \right) & \\ &= P\left( \overline{ \overline{S_1} \cap \overline{S_2}} \right) &\text{[De Morgan's Rule.]} \\ &= 1- P\left( \overline{S_1} \cap \overline{S_2} \right) & \\ &= 1-P( \overline{S_1} )P( \overline{S_2} )  & \\ &= 1- (1 - P(S_1) )(1 - P(S_2) ) & \\ &= 1- (1 - s_f(t, m) )^{2} & \end{align*}[/IMATH]

Let's call this the *advantaged-success* function, [IMATH]s_a[/IMATH], and substitute in [IMATH]s_f[/IMATH]:

> [MATH]s_a(t,m) = 1 - \left( \frac{1}{20}(t-m-21) + 1 \right)^2 = \frac{1}{400} (-t^2+2 d+399)[/MATH]

## Analysis

To get a feel for how advantage and disadvantage affect your outcome, let's assume [IMATH]m = 0[/IMATH] and plot the functions over [IMATH]t \in [1, 21][/IMATH]:

![flat-adv-dis-roll-comparison](img/flat-adv-dis-roll-comparison.png)

This matches what you would intuitively would expect. Rolling with advantage gets you better odds than a flat roll, and rolling with disadvantage puts you at... well, a disadvantage. Furthermore, the three functions converge at high at low DC/ACs where the success or failure are guaranteed.

### Ability Modifier Impact

When you increase your ability modifiers how much has your lot improved? Well, if we look at the *flat-success* function[POP][MATH]s_f(t, m) = (21 + m - t) \left( \frac{1}{20} \right)[/MATH][/POP] we see that it's a linear function, and so increasing or decreasing [IMATH]m[/IMATH] will just shift the plot of the function up and down. This also means that it's a straight-forward task to determine what percent difference is made by increasing [IMATH]m[/IMATH] --- we simply need to subtract a roll without a modifier from one with a modifier:

[MATH]\begin{align*} \Delta P(S) &= s_f(t, m) - s_f(t, 0) \\ &= \frac{21+m-t}{20}-\frac{21-t}{20} \\ &= \frac{21+m-t-21+t}{20} &= \frac{\cancel{21}-\cancel{t}+m-\cancel{21}+\cancel{t}}{20} \\ &= \frac{m}{20}\end{align*}[/MATH]

This means that for every +1 increase to our modifier, we get a [IMATH]\frac{1}{20}[/IMATH] or 5% improvement to our odds of success!

### Advantage vs Modifier

Are you better off taking a feat that lets you roll with advantage, or pumping up your ability scores to get that sweet +1 to your skill checks? Well, we know from above that for every +1 increase to our modifier the chance of success improves by 5%. This raises the question, how much of a percent increase do you gain by rolling with advantage? Looking at the graph of *advantaged-success* function[POP][MATH]s_a(t,m) = \frac{1}{400} (-t^2+2 d+399)[/MATH][/POP], the obvious answer is *"it depends"*. The function isn't linear, so how much of an increase we get is dependent on how difficult the task is.

But we can ask, *how much, __on average__, do our odds improve?* To answer this question we need to know the average values of our *flat-success*[POP][MATH]s_f(t, m) = (21 + m - t) \left( \frac{1}{20} \right)[/MATH][/POP] and *advantaged-success*[POP][MATH]s_a(t,m) = \frac{1}{400} (-t^2+2 d+399)[/MATH][/POP] functions. Again we'll assume [MATH]m=0[/MATH].

In the case of *flat-success*, since it's a line, the answer is simply 0.5 or 50%. But for our *advantaged-success* function we'll need to do some calculus. Sweet!

The equation for the average value of a function is:

[MATH]\bar f = \frac{1}{b-a}\int\limits_a^b {f\left( x \right) \, \text{d}x}[/MATH]

So we need to find:

[MATH]\bar s_a(t, 0) = \frac{1}{21-1}\int\limits_1^{21} {s_a(t, 0) \, \text{d}x}[/MATH]

I'll spare you the derivation --- and I'm embarrassed to admit that I had to dig up some old notes to freshen up my integration rules. But the average value of our *advantaged-success* function is [IMATH]\frac{2}{3}[/IMATH] or 66.6...%!


This means that rolling with advantage improves your odds by nearly a whopping 17%! In order to get a greater benefit from a modifier or bonus you would need at least a +4 increase, which is a lot!

*Advantage Wins!*

### Advantage vs +1 Weapon?
The case of a +1 weapon is slightly different as not only does your ability check get a +1 increase, but your damage roll *also* gets a +1 increase. So we need to rework the problem with the damage factored.

To answer this question, we need to find the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of a roll that uses a +1 weapon as well as one that doesn't. The general equation for expected value is:

[MATH]E[X]=\sum_{i=1}^{k} x_{i} \, p_{i}[/MATH]

Where [IMATH]x_i[/IMATH] represents the value of each possible outcome, and [IMATH]p_i[/IMATH] is the probability of that outcome. In our case, there are only two outcomes, success and failure, and in the case of failure the value of the outcome is zero.

Denote the average damage from a weapon as [IMATH]g[/IMATH] and the outcome of an attack roll as  [IMATH]A[/IMATH]. For a regular attack roll the expected value, then, is:

[MATH]\begin{align*} E[A] &= g \, P(S) + 0 \cdot  P( \bar S) \\ &= g \, P(S) \end{align*}[/MATH]

For advantage, we simply replace [IMATH]P(S)[/IMATH] with our *advantaged-success* function (again assuming [IMATH]m=0[/IMATH]):

> [MATH]\begin{align*} E[A_a] &= g \, s_{a}(t, 0)  \end{align*}[/MATH]

For a +1 weapon, on the other hand, we replace [IMATH]P(S)[/IMATH] with our *flat-success* function, replace [IMATH]g[/IMATH] with [IMATH]g + 1[/IMATH], and set [IMATH]m = 1[/IMATH]:

> [MATH]\begin{align*} E[A_{+1}] &= (g + 1)  \; s_f(t, 1) \end{align*}[/MATH]

Unfortunately, the answer to our question will vary depending on the value of [IMATH]g[/IMATH]. For example, if we choose a rapier --- the favored weapon of my character [Niko Whitteridge](https://github.com/bryanbharper/Niko/blob/master/backstory.md) --- which has an average damage of 4.5,[POP][MATH]g_r = \left( \frac{1}{8} \right ) \sum \limits_{i=1}^8 i[/MATH][/POP] our two expected value functions look like this:

![rapier-ev-adv-vs-magi](img/rapier-ev-adv-vs-magi.PNG)

But if instead Niko used his Blowgun, which does exactly 1 damage, the functions would look like this:

![blowgun-ev-adv-vs-magi](img/blowgun-ev-adv-vs-magi.PNG)

So instead we're going to have to look at these as 3d functions. The average of a two-variable function is:

[MATH]\bar f = \frac{1}{(b-a)(d-c)} \int_a^b \int_c^d f(x,y) \, dx \, dy[/MATH]

As for the range of [IMATH]g[/IMATH] to integrate over, the most damage from a weapon I could find in [D&D Beyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) was an Antimatter Rifle, with 6d8 damage, resulting in an average damage of 27.[POP][MATH] g_{am} = \left( \frac{6}{8} \right ) \sum \limits_{i=1}^8 i[/MATH][/POP]

> *If you find something that does more damage let me know, and I'll recalculate.*

So let's calculate the average expected value for an attack roll with advantage:

[MATH]\begin{align*} \bar E [A_a] &= \frac{1}{(27-1)(21-1)} \int_{1}^{27} \int_{1}^{21} g \, s_a (t, 0) \, dt \, dg \\ &= \frac{28}{3} \\ &\approx 9.3 \end{align*}[/MATH]

Now let's do the same for a +1 weapon:

[IMATH]\begin{align*} \bar E [A_{+1}] &= \frac{1}{(27-1)(21-1)} \int_{1}^{27} \int_{1}^{21} (g + 1) \, s_f (t, 1) \, dt \, dg \\ &\approx 10.1731 \end{align*}[/IMATH]

So *on average* the +1 weapon appears to be a *slightly* better choice than rolling with advantage. However, it is worth taking the particular weapon your character uses into consideration. Take a look at the animated graph below. The value of [IMATH]g[/IMATH] is being varied from low to high and back. At high values of [IMATH]g[/IMATH] the orange advantage curve appears to be the better option. But at lower values, the blue +1 weapon function sneaks ahead. So choose accordingly.
> *It's worth noting that 27 damage is *unusually high*. Most weapons will do significantly less damage.*
